### Hi there 👋

I'm Giovanni from Chicago, and I am a Full Stack Developer. I took a leap of faith, and emerged into the tech industry after leaving my job at Apple to learn how to code. I am passionate about what makes an app operate, and what happens under the hood. React ⚛️ and Node.js are my bread and butter. Updates through my Full Stack journey on https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanni-rosales-24bab5115/
